# DNN-Object-Detection-YOLO3
deep learning based object detection using YOLOv3 with OpenCV

## There are three main object detectors using deep learning:-

1. R-CNN (Selective Search), Fast R-CNN( Region proposed Network and R-CNN).  
2. Single shot detectors (SSD).  
3. YOLO.  

Both SSD and YOLO use one-stage detector strategy.  

## Requirements:-  

1. OpenCV 3.4.2 and above.  

## Usage:-  

1. <code> python3 yolo.py 'path to image' . </code>
